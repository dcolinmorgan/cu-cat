# About

cu_cat shares much of its DNA with
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).

cu_cat is the continuation of [dirty-cat](http://dirty-cat.github.io)
with a broader scope and a broader ambition.

cu_cat is a young project born from research. We really need people
giving feedback on successes and failures with the different techniques
on real world data, and pointing us to open datasets on which we can do
more empirical work.

cu_cat received funding from [project
DirtyData](https://project.inria.fr/dirtydata/) (ANR-17-CE23-0018).
